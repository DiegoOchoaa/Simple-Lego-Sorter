# Simple-Lego-Sorter
A semi-automatic cost-effective lego sorter using Rasberry pi and Arduino. It works by first sending an image captured from the rasberry pi camera to the brickognize API then sending that information to the arduino via serial and the arduino uses the piece's category to determine which box it goes in
